      <p>in this module ive yapped two things: some of my context and announcement of OPEN SOURCE series.</p>
      
      <h3>some of my context: </h3>
      <p>so my name is Ajeet and these are some of my achievements so far:</p>
      <img src="/images/module-1.webp" alt="Ajeet's work screenshot" style="width: 60%; max-width: 60%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px auto; display: block;" />
      
      <p>im telling you this not to show off but to make a point that what we can achieve through OPEN SOURCE in 3 years.</p>
      
      <p>especially in my case, <a href="https://x.com/ajeetunc/status/1989355142081065468?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #9455f4; text-decoration: underline;">the background</a>  i come from and the college i come from achieving all of this in 3 years was i mean at least for me was next to impossible because i had never thought that i will ever be able to do all of that.</p>
      
      <p>if i be honest with you then my initial plan was to get around 4 to 5 LPA job at any company because at that time i was very desperate to get into tech and i was thinking that okay i will just get into tech and then i will go for something bigger.</p>
      
      <p>so that was my plan. but fortunately the 4 LPA thing i was able to get it in my second year itself as a stipend of my first internship and all of this was possible through OPEN SOURCE.</p>
      
      <p>that was the best thing that happened to me. i was able to contribute to OPEN SOURCE and i was able to connect with some really cool people who introduced me to some organizations and to some really cool open-source projects that led me to some really great opportunities including an interview at lovable.</p>
      
      <p>so i will tell you more about this lovable thing later in this module.</p>
      
      <p>these are only the direct results that i got from OPEN SOURCE but there are also some indirect results that i got and in those indirect results one is like connections and recognition.</p>
      
      <p>so when i started contributing to open-source people started recognizing me, i mean people started kind of making a connection and i was able to make connection with maintainers and CTOs and even CEOs of couple of companies even VC backed companies.</p>
      
      <p>so those connections really help me whenever i either want to get an interview or want something else. then pinging those people who i already know makes it a lot easier to get something.</p>
      
      <p>and the second thing i got from OPEN SOURCE and that is a strong profile. so i still know that there was a time when whenever i used to apply for an opening then there used to be 100% chances of rejection because at one point i was getting rejected from almost any opening.</p>
      
      <p>then i shifted my focus from applying to started contributing to OPEN SOURCE and for around one and a half year i just contributed to OPEN SOURCE and all the experience that i got from OPEN SOURCE i mentioned in my resume and my portfolio and as a result of that i started noticing really great results from the openings like most of the times my profile started getting selected.</p>
      
      <p>and also once i send my profile to the founder of lovable and it was selected and i was able to land an interview at lovable.</p>

      <img src="/images/lv-1.webp" alt="Ajeet's work screenshot" style="width: 60%; max-width: 60%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px auto; display: block;" />
      
      <p>so the strong portfolio and strong profile is the second indirect benefit of OPEN SOURCE. </p>
      
      <p>and the third indirect benefit of OPEN SOURCE is that whenever you see an opening job opening these days 99.99% of the times you will see a line there that "if you have done OPEN SOURCE and if you have contributed to OPEN SOURCE then it's a plus point" and most of the time i get that plus point because it really makes your profile unique when you have already contributed to some OPEN SOURCE companies especially the competitors of the company that you are applying for.</p>
      
      <p>so once i had applied for a payment company and fortunately i had already made contributions to a similar payment company that was based in Europe. so my resume was shortlisted and i was able to get interview really fast just because of those OPEN SOURCE contributions that i had made to that payment company.</p>

      <img src="/images/ptm.webp" alt="Ajeet's work screenshot" style="width: 60%; max-width: 60%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px auto; display: block;" />
      
      <p>overall i mean my whole point is that the ROI that you get from OPEN SOURCE is not limited. so you won't even believe where OPEN SOURCE can take you in the next one or two years.</p>
      
      <p>but all of this journey, all of this open-source journey so far was not easy to be honest because especially in my case when i had no senior or not someone to whom i can go and ask something there was always a problem of doubts. there was always a problem of not having a human feedback.</p>
      
      <p>so everything and anything ive learned so far was a is a result of observing things and observing people like how do they do it and how they are making contributions and how are they tackling issues.</p>
      
      <p>so when we contribute to OPEN SOURCE there is not only one problem that we face there are a lot of problems that we have to go through and couple of those problems are like not able to find the project.</p>
      
      <p>so that is the first and the one of the most complex problem when we contribute to OPEN SOURCE. so because let's say as a new contributor we don't even know like which project we have to contribute to.</p>
      
      <p>so but to be honest initially it doesn't matter much like you can contribute to any OPEN SOURCE project depending on your tech stack or on your preferences but again it's still a hustle kind of thing because we are not able to land on a good project.</p>
      
      <p>so that is why i had created <a href="https://www.opensox.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #9455f4; text-decoration: underline;">opensox.ai</a> and i'm still working on that. but that was the first problem and there was a second problem as well. </p>
      
      <p>when we are very new and when we contribute to repositories that are pretty famous and very complex code bases then we face a lot of competition or a lot of saturation because there are a lot of people who are making contributions parallelly and there we have to make contributions as a beginner.</p>
      
      <p>so it creates a lot of problems for us because we are not even able to fix smaller issues because for each issue there are a lot of people already competing there. so that is the second problem.</p>
      
      <p>there is also a third problem and that is getting overwhelmed. </p>
      
      <p>so basically when we are new and when we have no experience to OPEN SOURCE we easily get overwhelmed by all of these things because there are a lot of tools a lot of practices that we have to follow and also there are a lot of things that we have to know be it technology or be it patterns that that particular organization follow and also each organization or each OPEN SOURCE projects has its own technologies has its own paradigms of contributing the code to it.</p>
      
      <p>so it makes it really hard for a new contributor to start contributing. it takes a lot of months for them to get started with OPEN SOURCE.</p>
      
      <p>there is one more very painful problem that we face while contributing to OPEN SOURCE and that is not getting attention of the maintainers. so imagine you work on something for weeks and when you raise a PR then there is no one to look to that look at that PR or to review that PR.</p>
      
      <p>so that's really painful and in most of the cases it's not the mistake of maintainers it's the mistake of contributors. so either they have chosen a wrong issue or something that's not important or a thousand reasons by which it can happen you may not get the attention that you need.</p>
      
      <p>so it is really demotivating and disappointing when you work on something for so long and no one look at it. so these are the these are kind of problems that most of the people face when they are new to OPEN SOURCE.</p>
      
      <p>so to document everything what ive learned through open-source i'm going to create an open-source series of around 30 to 40 modules and in this series i'm going to explain everything in details from finding projects to finding opportunities in OPEN SOURCE companies or organizations.</p>
      
      <p>there are two reasons why this series contains 30 plus modules. number one, it this series is for absolute beginners or the people who face problems while contributing to OPEN SOURCE.</p>
      
      <p>and the second reason is there are a lot of smaller details that matters a lot but most of the times it is either ignored by people who already teach on YouTube or it is mostly unheard it is not documented.</p>
      
      <p>so that is why this series is going to be long enough to contain everything that is important for a beginner or the person who is facing problems while contributing to OPEN SOURCE.</p>
      
      <p>this is what this series will contain: </p>

      <img src="/images/sheet-1.webp" alt="Ajeet's work screenshot" style="width: 60%; max-width: 60%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px auto; display: block;" />

      <img src="/images/sheet-2.webp" alt="Ajeet's work screenshot" style="width: 60%; max-width: 60%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px auto; display: block;" />

      <p>also there are going to be couple of bonus modules or couple of ad hoc modules. so if i for forget something in this list then i will cover all of that in these bonus modules</p>
      
      <h3 style="margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #9455f4;">todos:</h3>
      <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0;">

          <span style="position: absolute; left: 0;">☐</span>
          <span>make a firm decision to do OPEN SOURCE</span>
        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; padding-left: 24px; position: relative;">
          <span style="position: absolute; left: 0;">☐</span>

        </li>
        <li style="margin-bottom: 12px; padding-left: 24px; position: relative;">
          <span style="position: absolute; left: 0;">☐</span>
          <span>rest todos in the next module
          </span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>finally, that's all in this module. i'll yap more in the next module. take care.</p>
